Fork or of gdevine_ucsc's chess repo for CMPM 123 - Advanced Programming

Most recent implementation has basic FEN string implementation as well as movement for knights, kings, and pawns.
Current implementation for movement of knights, kings, and pawns follows a naive approach of iterating through the state string
  in order to find pieces and their valid moves. Once I understand better how bit boards work I'll be refactoring the code to use that instead.

En Passant, Castling, and Pawn Promotion are not present yet
